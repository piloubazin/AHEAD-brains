# AHEAD-brains
Project repository for the AHEAD Brains project for the OHBM Brainhack 2022

We recently made available a post-mortem data set including quantitative MRI and microscopy reconstructed in 3D at 200Âµm (see https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abj7892 for details). The data set is openly accessible on FigShare already, but we would like to do more to help integrate it in other open science platforms to promote collaborative exploration of the data.

Goals for the Brainhack:
- set up a version of the data set that fits into Brainbox (https://brainbox.pasteur.fr/)
- check how the data is handled by various visualization tools, make recommendations
- import initial parcellations from automated tools (nighres so far, but others could be run) into the visualizations
- manually annotate errors, artifacts, inconsistencies
- delineate new structures collaboratively

We will update this project as things develop in Glasgow!
